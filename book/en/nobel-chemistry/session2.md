# Session 2 - Computational Protein Design and De Novo Protein Engineering

This session will cover the advances in **computational protein design** that led to the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, awarded to **David Baker** for his pioneering work in **de novo protein engineering**. We will explore the key methods used in designing new proteins, the applications of these novel proteins in various fields, and the broader implications for synthetic biology and biotechnology.

## 1. Introduction to Computational Protein Design

- **Protein Engineering and De Novo Design**: Unlike natural proteins, which have evolved over millions of years, **de novo protein design** aims to create entirely new proteins with custom functions that do not exist in nature.
  - **David Baker's Vision**: Baker's goal was to harness computational power to design proteins with **specific structures and functions**. This led to the creation of the **Rosetta** software, a platform for designing novel proteins and predicting their structures.
- **Why De Novo Design Matters**: The ability to design proteins from scratch provides immense opportunities for **medicine**, **environmental solutions**, and **industrial biotechnology**.
  - **Figure Reference**: **Figure 3** shows a depiction of the computational design of a protein structure, highlighting the key elements involved in the de novo engineering process.

## 2. The Rosetta Platform and Protein Design Process

- **Rosetta Software**: Developed by David Baker and his team, **Rosetta** is used to design proteins that fold in specific ways to perform desired functions. It utilizes **energy minimization algorithms** to predict the most stable structure for a given sequence.

  - **Energy Landscape Exploration**: Proteins adopt the lowest energy conformation in their folding process. Rosetta explores various folding pathways to identify the optimal conformation for designed sequences.
  - **Figure Reference**: **Figure 2** illustrates the workflow used by Rosetta, showing how protein sequences are computationally optimized to predict functional three-dimensional structures.

- **From Sequence to Function**: The design process begins with defining the **desired function**, such as binding a specific molecule or catalyzing a chemical reaction.
  - **Amino Acid Selection**: The sequence of amino acids is chosen to optimize the stability and functionality of the desired protein. Rosetta's computational algorithms predict the sequence that will best achieve the target structure.
  - **Experimental Validation**: Once designed, the protein is synthesized in the lab, and its structure and function are validated through **crystallography**, **NMR**, or other experimental techniques.

## 3. Applications of De Novo Proteins

- **Medical Innovations**:

  - **Novel Enzymes and Therapeutics**: De novo proteins have been designed to act as enzymes that can catalyze reactions not found in nature, opening possibilities for **drug development** and **gene editing**.
  - **Vaccine Development**: Engineered proteins are being used as **immunogens** to develop vaccines for challenging diseases, including the development of nanoparticles that can mimic viruses and elicit immune responses.
  - **Figure Reference**: **Figure 5** presents examples of de novo proteins used for creating vaccines and therapeutic agents.

- **Environmental and Industrial Applications**:
  - **Bioremediation**: Custom proteins are being engineered to break down **pollutants** and **plastic waste**, providing environmentally-friendly solutions for managing industrial by-products.
  - **Green Chemistry**: Proteins that catalyze specific chemical reactions can be used in industrial processes to reduce the need for harmful chemicals, promoting **sustainable production**.

## 4. Broader Implications and Challenges

- **Synthetic Biology and the Future of Biotechnology**: The success of de novo protein design is paving the way for **synthetic biology**, where organisms can be engineered to produce new biomolecules, addressing global challenges in health, environment, and energy.
  - **Designing Life from Scratch**: The ability to create custom proteins lays the foundation for designing new biological systems, effectively engineering life at the molecular level.
