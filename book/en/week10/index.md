# Week 10 - Building LLM-based Q&A Systems

## Overview

This week focuses on building Question-Answering (Q&A) systems using Large Language Models. Students will learn about vector databases for efficient information retrieval, document parsing techniques, and the integration of these components with LLMs. This knowledge forms the foundation for more advanced applications like RAG systems that will be covered in Week 13 and prepares students for practical implementation in their final projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Understand the architecture and components of LLM-based Q&A systems
2. Implement document parsing and preprocessing for Q&A applications
3. Work with vector databases for efficient information storage and retrieval
4. Create a basic Q&A system by integrating document processing with LLMs
5. Evaluate and optimize Q&A system performance

## Key Topics

### 1. Introduction to LLM-based Q&A Systems

- Architecture overview of modern Q&A systems
- Comparison with traditional Q&A approaches
- Components and their interactions:
  - Document processing pipeline
  - Vector storage and retrieval
  - LLM integration
  - Response generation

### 2. Document Processing and Parsing

- Document preprocessing techniques
  - Text extraction and cleaning
  - Chunking strategies
  - Metadata extraction
- Handling different document formats
  - Plain text
  - PDF documents
  - HTML content
  - Structured data (JSON, CSV)
- Information extraction methods
  - Regular expressions
  - Rule-based parsing
  - LLM-assisted extraction

### 3. Vector Databases and Embeddings

- Understanding vector databases
  - Purpose and advantages
  - Popular solutions (Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus)
- Document embeddings
  - Embedding models and techniques
  - Dimension reduction strategies
  - Similarity search methods
- Vector database operations
  - Indexing documents
  - Querying and retrieval
  - Updating and maintenance

### 4. System Integration and Implementation

- Connecting components
  - Document processor integration
  - Vector database connectivity
  - LLM API integration
- Query processing pipeline
  - Query understanding
  - Context retrieval
  - Response generation
- Error handling and edge cases
  - Invalid queries
  - Missing information
  - Confidence scoring

## Practical Component

In this week's practical session, you will:

- Set up a vector database using Pinecone or similar service
- Implement document parsing and embedding generation
- Create a simple Q&A system using OpenAI's API
- Test and evaluate system performance with various query types

## Assignment

Design and implement a basic Q&A system that can:

1. Process and store a collection of provided documents
2. Accept natural language questions
3. Retrieve relevant information from the document collection
4. Generate accurate answers using an LLM

Deliverables:

- Working Q&A system implementation
- Documentation of design choices and implementation details
- Performance evaluation results
- Brief report on challenges faced and solutions implemented

## Looking Ahead

Next week, we'll explore web application development basics, learning how to create user interfaces for our Q&A systems using Flask or Streamlit. This will enable us to build complete, user-friendly applications that showcase the power of LLM-based systems.
