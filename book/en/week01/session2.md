# Week 1 Session 2 - The Revolution in Modern NLP

## 6. Evolution Towards Modern NLP

The transition from traditional NLP methods to modern approaches has been driven by advancements in machine learning, particularly in the field of deep learning. This evolution has addressed many of the challenges faced by traditional NLP systems and has led to significant improvements in performance across various NLP tasks.

### 6.1. Introduction of Word Embeddings

Word embeddings represent a fundamental shift in how we represent words in NLP systems. Unlike traditional one-hot encoding or bag-of-words models, word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words by representing them as dense vectors in a continuous vector space.

Key characteristics of word embeddings:

- Words with similar meanings are close to each other in the vector space
- Semantic relationships can be captured through vector arithmetic
- Lower-dimensional representations compared to one-hot encoding

Popular word embedding models:

1. Word2Vec (2013)
2. GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation, 2014)
3. FastText (2016)

Example: Using Word2Vec with Gensim

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
from gensim.models.word2vec import LineSentence

# Assume we have a text file 'corpus.txt' with one sentence per line
sentences = LineSentence('corpus.txt')

# Train the Word2Vec model
model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)

# Find similar words
similar_words = model.wv.most_similar('king', topn=5)
print("Words most similar to 'king':")
for word, score in similar_words:
    print(f"{word}: {score:.4f}")

# Perform word arithmetic
result = model.wv.most_similar(positive=['king', 'woman'], negative=['man'], topn=1)
print("\nking - man + woman =", result[0][0])
```

Word embeddings have several advantages over traditional representations:

1. Capture semantic relationships between words
2. Reduce dimensionality of word representations
3. Enable transfer learning by using pre-trained embeddings

### 6.2. Rise of Deep Learning in NLP

The adoption of deep learning techniques in NLP has led to significant improvements in performance across various tasks. Key neural network architectures used in NLP include:

1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
2. Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for text

    B --> E[Sequence Modeling]
    C --> F[Long-term Dependencies]
    D --> G[Feature Extraction]
```

Example: Simple RNN for sentiment analysis using PyTorch

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(embedding_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, text):
        embedded = self.embedding(text)
        output, hidden = self.rnn(embedded)
        return self.fc(hidden.squeeze(0))

# Example usage (assuming preprocessed data)
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 100
hidden_dim = 256
output_dim = 2  # Binary sentiment (positive/negative)

model = SimpleRNN(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)
```

Deep learning models have several advantages in NLP:

1. Automatic feature learning
2. Ability to capture complex patterns and long-range dependencies
3. Flexibility to adapt to various NLP tasks

### 6.3. Emergence of Transformer Models

The introduction of the Transformer architecture in 2017 (Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need") marked a significant milestone in NLP. Transformers address limitations of RNNs and LSTMs, such as the difficulty in parallelizing computations and capturing long-range dependencies.

Key components of Transformer architecture:

1. Self-attention mechanism
2. Multi-head attention
3. Positional encoding
4. Feed-forward neural networks

```{mermaid}

    A[Transformer] --> B[Encoder]
    A --> C[Decoder]
    B --> D[Self-Attention]
    B --> E[Feed-Forward NN]
    C --> F[Masked Self-Attention]
    C --> G[Encoder-Decoder Attention]
    C --> H[Feed-Forward NN]
```

Prominent Transformer-based models:

1. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
2. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
3. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

Example: Using a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example text
text = "This movie is fantastic! I really enjoyed watching it."

# Tokenize and encode the text
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)

# Make prediction
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    logits = outputs.logits
    predicted_class = torch.argmax(logits, dim=1).item()

print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
```

Transformer models have several advantages:

1. Parallelizable computations

1. Few-shot learning: Performing tasks with only a few examples
2. Zero-shot learning: Completing tasks without any specific training examples

Example of zero-shot classification using GPT-3:

```python
def zero_shot_classification(text, categories):
    prompt = f"Classify the following text into one of these categories: {', '.join(categories)}.\n\nText: {text}\n\nCategory:"
    return generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=1)

# Example usage
text = "The stock market saw significant gains today, with tech stocks leading the rally."
categories = ["Politics", "Economics", "Sports", "Technology"]
result = zero_shot_classification(text, categories)
print(f"Classified category: {result}")
```

Advantages of few-shot and zero-shot learning:

1. Reduced reliance on large labeled datasets
2. Ability to quickly adapt to new tasks or domains
3. Improved generalization to unseen examples

## 9. Current State and Future Directions

    prompt = f"""
    Analyze potential biases in language model responses for the following demographic groups: {', '.join(demographic_groups)}

    Context: {context}

    For each group, provide a brief analysis of potential biases:
    """
    return generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=200)

# Example usage
demographics = ["Gender", "Race", "Age", "Socioeconomic status"]
context = "Job applicant evaluation in the tech industry"
bias_analysis = probe_model_bias(demographics, context)
print(bias_analysis)
```
