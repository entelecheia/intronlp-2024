# Week 3: Fundamentals of Language Models

## Overview

This week, we delve into the foundational concepts of language models, which are essential components in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. We will focus on N-gram models and statistical language models, providing you with a solid understanding of how machines can predict and generate human-like text.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Understand the concept and importance of language models in NLP
2. Explain the theory behind N-gram models and their applications
3. Implement simple N-gram models using Python
4. Comprehend the basics of statistical language models
5. Evaluate the performance of language models using perplexity

## Key Topics

### 1. Introduction to Language Models

- Definition and purpose of language models
- Applications of language models in NLP tasks
- Historical context and evolution of language modeling techniques

### 2. N-gram Models

- Concept of N-grams (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etc.)
- Probability calculations in N-gram models
- Advantages and limitations of N-gram models
- Smoothing techniques for handling unseen N-grams

### 3. Statistical Language Models

- Probabilistic approach to language modeling
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Conditional probability in language models
- Challenges in statistical language modeling (data sparsity, context limitation)

### 4. Implementation of N-gram Models

- Building N-gram models from text corpora
- Generating text using N-gram models
- Handling out-of-vocabulary words

### 5. Evaluation of Language Models

- Introduction to perplexity as an evaluation metric
- Calculating perplexity for N-gram models
- Interpreting perplexity scores

## Practical Component

In this week's practical session, you will:

- Implement a simple N-gram model from scratch using Python
- Use NLTK to create and experiment with N-gram models
- Generate text using your implemented N-gram model
- Evaluate the performance of your models using perplexity

## Assignment

You will be given a text corpus and tasked with building N-gram models of various orders (unigram, bigram, trigram). You'll need to implement the models, generate text using each model, and compare their performance using perplexity. Additionally, you'll write a brief report discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each model based on your observations.

## Looking Ahead

The fundamental concepts of language models that you learn this week will serve as a stepping stone to more advanced topics in NLP. In the coming weeks, we'll explore more sophisticated language modeling techniques, including neural network-based approaches and state-of-the-art transformer models.
