# Week 12: Controlling and Structuring LLM Outputs

## Overview

Week 12 focuses on techniques and strategies for controlling and structuring outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs). We'll explore methods to ensure consistent, reliable, and well-formatted responses from LLMs, making them more suitable for practical applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand different techniques for output structuring in LLMs
- Learn how to implement prompt engineering for controlled outputs
- Master methods for formatting and validating LLM responses
- Explore JSON, XML, and other structured output formats
- Develop strategies for handling and parsing LLM outputs in applications

## Key Topics

1. Output Structuring Techniques
   - Template-based outputs
   - JSON and XML formatting
   - Markdown and other markup languages
2. Control Mechanisms
   - Temperature and sampling parameters
   - Stop sequences and length constraints
   - Format enforcement strategies
3. Validation and Error Handling
   - Output validation techniques
   - Error detection and correction
   - Fallback mechanisms

## Practical Component

Students will work on implementing various output control mechanisms:

- Design prompts for structured outputs
- Create validation systems for LLM responses
- Build parsers for different output formats
- Implement error handling for malformed outputs

## Assignment

Create a system that:

1. Implements at least three different output structuring methods
2. Includes validation for each output format
3. Handles errors gracefully
4. Demonstrates practical use cases for structured outputs

## Looking Ahead

Next week will focus on the final project presentations and course wrap-up, where we'll apply all the concepts learned throughout the course.
