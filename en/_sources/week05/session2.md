# Week 5 Session 2: BERT

## 1. Introduction to BERT

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) was introduced in 2018, marking a significant milestone in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The BERT paper presented a novel language representation model that outperformed previous models across a wide range of NLP tasks.

Key points about BERT:

- It's a deep bidirectional transformer model
- Pre-trained on a vast corpus of unlabeled text
- Designed to predict masked words within a sentence and anticipate the subsequent sentence
- Can be fine-tuned for various downstream NLP tasks

BERT builds upon two essential ideas:

1. The Transformer architecture
2. Unsupervised pre-training

Structure of BERT:

- 12 (or 24) layers
- 12 (or 16) attention heads
- 110 million parameters
- No weight sharing across layers

## 2. The Architecture of BERT

### 2.1 Attention Mechanism

The core component of BERT is the attention mechanism, which allows the model to assign weights to different parts of the input based on their importance for a specific task.

Example:
In the sentence "The dog from down the street ran up to me and \_\_\_", to complete the sentence, the model may give more attention to the word "dog" than to the word "street".

The attention mechanism takes two inputs:

1. Query: The part of the input we want to focus on
2. Key: The part of the input we want to compare the query to

The output is a weighted sum of the values of the key, with weights computed by a function of the query and the key.

This figure shows how a sequence of words (X) is represented as vectors, where each element (xi) is a value of dimension d.

```

This figure illustrates how attention transforms the input sequence X into an output sequence Y of the same length, composed of vectors with the same dimension.

### 2.2 Word Embeddings in BERT

BERT represents words as vectors (word embeddings) that capture various aspects of their meaning.

```

This figure shows how a sentence "the dog ran" is represented as a sequence of word embedding vectors.

Word embeddings allow for arithmetic operations on words:
Example: cat - kitten ≈ dog - puppy

### 2.3 Attention Mechanism Simplified

A[Input: the cat ran] --> B[Attention Weights] --> C[Output: cat]
```

This diagram illustrates a simplified version of the attention mechanism, showing how it focuses on important words in a sentence.

```{mermaid}
:align: center

graph LR
A[Input: the cat ran] --> B[Attention Weights: 0.1, 0.8, 0.1] --> C[Output: cat]
```

This diagram shows the attention mechanism with specific attention weights, demonstrating how the model focuses more on the word "cat" in this example.

## 3. Deconstructing Attention

### 3.1 Queries and Keys

Attention uses queries and keys to compute weights for each word in the input.

```

This figure shows how queries and keys are used in the attention mechanism.

The similarity between words is calculated by taking the dot product of their query and key vectors:

```

The dot product is then transformed into a probability using the softmax function:

The neuron view provides a detailed look at how attention weights are computed:

This figure breaks down the attention computation process:

- Query q: Encodes the word paying attention
- Key k: Encodes the word being attended to
- q×k (elementwise): Shows how individual elements contribute to the dot product
- q·k: The unnormalized attention score
- Softmax: Normalizes the attention scores

## 4. Multi-head Attention

BERT uses multiple attention mechanisms (heads) operating simultaneously:

- Each head represents a distinct attention mechanism
- Outputs of all heads are concatenated and fed into a feed-forward neural network
- Allows the model to learn a variety of relationships between words

## 5. Pre-training and Fine-tuning

BERT uses a two-step training process:

### 5.1 Pre-training

During pre-training, BERT is trained on a large corpus of unlabeled text data using two unsupervised learning objectives:

1. Masked Language Modeling (MLM):

   - Some words in a sentence are randomly masked
   - The model is trained to predict the masked words based on context
   - Forces the model to learn contextual representations of words

2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):
   - The model is given two sentences
   - It predicts whether the second sentence follows the first in the original text
   - Helps the model learn relationships between sentences and capture long-range dependencies

### 5.2 Fine-tuning

After pre-training, BERT is fine-tuned on specific NLP tasks using labeled data:

- The model is trained for a few additional epochs on task-specific datasets
- Pre-trained weights are updated to better capture patterns in the task-specific data
- Allows BERT to leverage knowledge from pre-training and adapt to specific tasks

This two-step process enables BERT to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering.

## Conclusion

BERT represents a significant advancement in NLP, offering a powerful and flexible approach to language understanding. Its use of bidirectional context, attention mechanisms, and the two-step training process allows it to capture complex linguistic patterns and achieve superior performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.
